# Doot
This was a joke program i did for "Spooktober". Checks wether it is october or not, and gives a different text if it is.

Some elements may not work right now as the computer hosting them is down for the time being.

I think the downloaded files save in the %temp% directory but i'm not sure as it was created a long time ago.
